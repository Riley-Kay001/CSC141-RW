1-2 The error made on my python was a spelling error. I wrote the word "pront" instead of the print function and python was able to detect my error. There was a second error detected in my greeting for not having round brackets around it.
1-3 I would want to create is working on a data analysis tool for sociology. I also have a goal of creating an operating system for windows. Lastly I would create a robotic system advancing forensic technology.
